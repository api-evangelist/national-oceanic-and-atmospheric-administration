  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a federal agency
  within the United States Department of Commerce that focuses on monitoring and
  predicting changes in the Earth's environment. NOAA's mission is to understand
  and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts in order to inform
  and protect the nation's economy, environment, and public safety. The agency
  conducts research and collects data on various aspects of the Earth's
  atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems to provide valuable information for
  policymakers, businesses, and the public. NOAA also manages and protects
  marine resources, enforces regulations related to fishing and marine
  conservation, and operates a network of satellites and monitoring systems to
  track and study the Earth's environment.
